# printed-spectroscope

## 3D printed spectroscope based on transmission grating and webcam sensor

Initially created by Ondrej Votava, Eliska Vitkova, Martin Vondra, and Zdenek Krajicek 

in the framework of programme "Otevrena Veda" (Open Science) for talented high-school students
2019

Design files, build instructions, and associated software for 3D printed USB spectroscope. This project is intended as educational tool to introduce concepts of spectroscopy to students(advanced high school, or college). 

### Basic characteristics:

Spectral range: 380nm - 750nm

Spectral resolution: ~5nm

Dispersion element: transmission diffraction grating foil, 1000 lines/mm

Sensor: CMOS VGA 640x480 (VGA webcam chip)

Connection to computer: USB

Software development environment: Processing3 with G4P GUI builder, grafica, and Video libraries

3D printed parts designed with FreeCAD.
